Here’s a **verified + expanded** picture of the **hypothalamus**: **what it does, what it connects to, and how it’s divided**, in a way that matches your internal notes and mainstream neuroanatomy.

## What it is and what it does (verified)

Your docs are correct that the hypothalamus is a **homeostasis controller**: it monitors internal state and drives corrective responses via **endocrine**, **autonomic**, and **behavioral** outputs. ([NCBI][1])

Key functions (high confidence, widely supported):

- **Endocrine control** via the pituitary (releasing/inhibiting hormones and posterior pituitary hormones). ([NCBI][1])
- **Autonomic regulation** (cardiovascular, GI, thermoregulation) via brainstem/spinal cord pathways. ([PMC][2])
- **Circadian timing** via SCN (master clock receiving retinal light input). ([NCBI][3])
- **Stress response** (PVN → CRH → HPA axis; plus autonomic outputs). ([Physiological Journals][4])
- **Sleep–wake regulation** (VLPO sleep-promoting; LHA orexin + TMN histamine arousal).

## Where it is (context)

Anatomically it sits **under the thalamus**, forming the floor/lower walls of the **3rd ventricle**, and connects to the pituitary via the **infundibulum (stalk)**. ([NCBI][1])

## How it’s divided (the “how many divisions” part)

### 1) Anterior → Posterior regions (3 main regions)

Your materials use a very standard scheme:

1. **Anterior (supraoptic/chiasmatic)**
2. **Middle (tuberal)**
3. **Posterior (mammillary)**

Many anatomy texts also split out a **preoptic** region as an “anterior-most” subdivision; some sources present **4 regions** (preoptic, supraoptic, tuberal, mammillary). ([Medscape eMedicine][5])

### 2) Medial → Lateral zones (3 zones)

Also standard (and in your map): ([Kenhub][6])

- **Periventricular zone** (next to 3rd ventricle; many hypophysiotropic neurons)
- **Medial/intermediate zone** (most discrete nuclei)
- **Lateral zone** (diffuse lateral hypothalamic area; arousal/feeding)

So, depending on how you count:

- **3 regions (A/M/P)** + **3 zones (peri/med/lat)** is the cleanest “grid” model.
- Or **4 regions** if you treat **preoptic** as its own.

## What it connects to (inputs and outputs)

### Inputs (what informs the hypothalamus)

Your detailed PVN notes and overall map are consistent with the literature:

- **Cortex** (mPFC/ACC/insula) → top-down regulation, interoception, pain/stress context.
- **Limbic structures**

  - **Amygdala → PVN** strongly drives stress/autonomic activation. ([PMC][2])
  - **Hippocampus → mammillary bodies** (via fornix) in the Papez circuit.

- **Brainstem (NTS, LC, raphe, parabrachial, PAG)** → visceral state, arousal, defensive signals.
- **Blood-borne signals** (leptin/ghrelin/insulin/cortisol, etc.), often via regions with weaker BBB influence—your arcuate/PVN notes capture that idea. ([NCBI][1])
- **Retina → SCN** (retinohypothalamic tract) for light entrainment. ([NCBI][3])

### Outputs (what the hypothalamus controls)

Two big “pipes” (your doc is correct here):

**1) Endocrine (pituitary control)**

- **Anterior pituitary:** releasing/inhibiting hormones into the **hypophyseal portal system** at the median eminence. ([NCBI][1])
- **Posterior pituitary:** direct axons from **SON/PVN** releasing **vasopressin (ADH)** and **oxytocin**. ([NCBI][1])

**2) Autonomic/behavioral (descending control)**

- To **brainstem autonomic and arousal nuclei** (NTS/RVLM/DMV; LC/raphe/PPT/LDT etc.).
- To **spinal cord** (hypothalamospinal pathways influencing sympathetic/parasympathetic outflow).

**Limbic/cognitive loop output**

- **Mammillary bodies → anterior thalamus** (mammillothalamic tract) as part of the Papez circuit memory loop.

## “So what are the key nuclei and what do they do?”

A compact, verified set (matching your file and standard sources):

### Anterior / preoptic region

- **POA (preoptic area):** thermoregulation + sleep-related functions.
- **SCN:** master circadian clock; retinal input. (Neuron count varies by species; “~20k” is a common order-of-magnitude claim, but not universal.) ([NCBI][3])
- **SON & PVN (magnocellular):** oxytocin/vasopressin → posterior pituitary. ([NCBI][1])

### Tuberal (middle) region

- **Arcuate:** metabolic sensing + feeding control; hypophysiotropic outputs (e.g., GHRH, dopamine).
- **VMH/VMN:** key satiety/defensive/sexual behavior node (avoid calling it the _only_ “satiety center”—it’s a network).
- **DMH:** important relay for SCN signals; links circadian timing to feeding/arousal/stress.
- **LHA (orexin):** arousal + feeding drive; broad projections.

### Posterior (mammillary) region

- **TMN (histamine):** arousal/wake; promotes tonic thalamic relay mode in your map.
- **Posterior hypothalamic area:** heat conservation + arousal + BP regulation.
- **Mammillary bodies:** memory relay (Papez circuit).

### PVN special mention (because it’s a “hub”)

Modern reviews emphasize PVN as a major **autonomic + neuroendocrine control center** (stress, cardiovascular, osmotic homeostasis), consistent with your PVN section. ([Frontiers][7])
