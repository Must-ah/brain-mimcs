# Brain Knowledge Base

> **Purpose:** Scientifically-verified reference material for brain-faithful architecture.

## Trust Model

**ALL files are assumed WRONG until verified against scientific papers.**

| Status | Can Use? |
|--------|----------|
| VERIFIED | Yes |
| Everything else | No |

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `verified.md` | Tracks verification status of all documents |
| `sources.md` | Scientific papers and references used |
| `README.md` | This file |
| `*.md` | Knowledge documents (add your files here) |

## Adding Files

1. Add your `.md` file to this folder
2. The expert agent will detect it
3. Expert will verify against scientific papers
4. Status updated in `verified.md`
5. Only VERIFIED content will be used

## Verification Process

The neuroscience expert agent will:
1. Read each document thoroughly (every line)
2. Verify claims against scientific papers
3. Correct inaccuracies (with citations)
4. Update `verified.md` with status
5. Add references to `sources.md`
6. Create new knowledge files if discoveries made

## Do Not

- Use unverified content as source of truth
- Assume any file is correct until verified
- Skip verification steps
